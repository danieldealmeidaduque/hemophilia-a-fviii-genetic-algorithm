# Project to diagnose hemophilia severity using only sequence of amino acids and a point mutation

## Description

This project have several functionalities such as:

Obs: Here "sequence" is the same as "sequence of amino acids"

### genetic_algorithm_hemophilia.py

#### input
* point mutation csv file
* amino acids distance matrix excel file
* relative surface area csv file

#### output

#### functionalities
* read files and combine then
  * link wild amino acid and new amino acid with distance matrix
  * link position hgvs with relative surface area
  * ... try to predict
